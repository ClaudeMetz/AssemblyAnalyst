aa-magnetic-selection=Magnetic selection snaps the analysis area to the outside borders of the machines in your selection.
aa-resnap-zone-on-change=Re-applies the magnetic selection algorithm when a relevant entity is added to or removed from a particular zone.
aa-reset-data-on-change=Resets the data collected about a particular zone when a relevant entity is added to or removed from it.
aa-exclude-inserters=Excludes inserters from your analysis zones to reduce the total amount of entities that are being tracked, improving performance.
aa-render-scale=Exaggerate the size of smaller bars. 1 means bar lengths are proportional to time in each state, larger values exaggerate the size of smaller bars.

[tips-and-tricks-item-description]
aa-introduction=[font=default-semibold]Welcome to Assembly Analyst![/font]\n\nThis mod gives you a tool that allows you to select certain parts of your factory for analysis, providing you with a breakdown of what your assemblers, miners, labs, and inserters spend their time on. It starts collecting this data the moment you create a new zone, meaning it'll display activity [font=default-bold]over time[/font] and not just the current status. This makes it easy for you to find bottlenecks and optimize the flow of your factory.\n\nThe details of how this works are illustrated by the following tips.
aa-how-to-get-started=To get started, you need to aquire the Assembly Analyst [font=default-bold]selection tool[/font]. This can be done in a couple of ways:\n- You could use the quickbar shortcut as shown above. You might need to enable it first.\n- You can also use the keyboard shortcut __CONTROL__aa-select-zone__\n\nTake note that this tool can only exist in your cursor, meaning you can't put it into your inventory.
aa-selection-tool=With the selection tool in hand, you can create zones of entities on the map that should be analyzed.\n\nIt works much like a deconstruction planner: Select the area you want to analyze by dragging the selection tool, as seen on the left. This will create a blue square to indicate the borders of the zone you've created. To remove a zone, [font=default-semibold][color=#84CDEC]shift[/color][/font]-drag over it, as seen on the right. The selection box should appear in red and will remove any zone that it touches.\n\nTake note that these zones are shared between all players, and that you should remove unused ones to avoid an unnessecary performance impact.
aa-entity-status=Every entity can have five different states it can be in, each of which is denoted by a specific color:\n- [color=0,135,0]Working[/color]: Everything is working as expected and the entity is active\n- [color=102,224,0]Output overload[/color]: The output of this machine or the drop-off point of this inserter is full\n- [color=255,165,0]Input shortage[/color]: The input of this machine or the pick-up point of this inserter is empty\n- [color=204,0,0]Insufficient power[/color]: This entity does not get enough power to function optimally\n- [color=204,0,204]Disabled[/color]: This entity is missing a recipe or technology to work on or is disabled by circuit network
aa-mod-settings=The mod offers various settings to customize it to your needs. You can find these by going to Settings→Mod Settings→Map→Assembly Analyst.\n\n[font=default-bold]Magnetic selection[/font] snaps the analysis area to the outside borders of the machines in your selection.\n[font=default-bold]Re-snap on change[/font] re-applies the magnetic selection algorithm when a relevant entity is added to or removed from a particular zone.\n[font=default-bold]Reset data on change[/font] resets the data collected about a particular zone when a relevant entity is added to or removed from it.\n[font=default-bold]Ignore inserters[/font] excludes inserters from your analysis zones to reduce the total amount of entities that are being tracked, improving performance.\n\nYou can also adjust the color of every status type in case you are having trouble distinguishing them.
